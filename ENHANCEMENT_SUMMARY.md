# Accounting System Enhancement Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Whitespace Issue with Department Code Replacements

**Problem**: 
- The mapping `"VINCOM 304": "VINCOM 304 L2-12"` had whitespace in the key
- During processing in `clean_department_code()`, whitespace was removed BEFORE applying replacements
- This caused the search to fail because `"VINCOM304"` (without spaces) couldn't match `"VINCOM 304"` (with spaces) in the mapping

**Root Cause**: 
In the original logic at line 1150 of `counterparty_extractor.py`:
1. Split department code by separator
2. Take last element  
3. **Remove spaces** (Step 3)
4. **Apply replacements** (Step 4)

The problem was that spaces were removed before checking for replacements, so patterns with spaces like `"VINCOM 304"` could never be found.

**Solution**:
1. **Reordered the steps**: Apply replacements BEFORE removing spaces
2. **Enhanced pattern matching**: Check for patterns in the full string first, before splitting
3. **Improved replacement logic**: Sort patterns by length (longest first) to handle overlapping patterns correctly

**Key Changes in `clean_department_code()` method**:
- Added full-string pattern matching before splitting
- Moved replacement logic to occur before space removal
- Added proper logging for debugging transformation steps
- Implemented pattern priority handling (longer patterns matched first)

### 2. KL-PSHV Code Processing Consistency

**Problem**: 
- When processing statements with "KL-PSHV" code, the debit/credit account assignments were not consistent with other POS machine accounts

**Root Cause**: 
The mapping `"PSHV 2F18": "PSHV"` was being processed correctly, but the issue was in the whitespace handling described above. Once the whitespace issue was fixed, PSHV processing became consistent.

**Solution**: 
The PSHV processing issue was resolved by fixing the whitespace handling. The system now correctly:
1. Finds `"PSHV 2F18"` pattern in department codes like `"GO-PSHV 2F18"`
2. Maps it to `"PSHV"` 
3. Uses this cleaned code for counterparty lookup
4. Applies the same account determination logic as other POS machines

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Department Code Cleaning Algorithm

```python
def clean_department_code(self, department_code: str) -> str:
    # Step 1: Check for known patterns in the full string first
    # This handles cases like "SOME-VINCOM 304 L2-12" where the pattern 
    # "VINCOM 304 L2-12" appears in the middle, not at the end
    
    # Step 2: If found, apply replacement directly
    # Use the mapped value and remove spaces
    
    # Step 3: If no full-string match, fall back to split-and-process
    # Split by "-" or "_", take last element, then apply replacements
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Pattern Priority**: Longer patterns are matched first to avoid conflicts
2. **Full-String Matching**: Patterns are found anywhere in the input, not just at the end
3. **Better Logging**: Detailed transformation logs help with debugging
4. **Robust Replacement**: Single-match policy prevents unexpected multiple replacements

## Test Results

All test cases now work correctly:

```
DD.TINH_VINCOM 304 -> VINCOM304L2-12        ✓ (full-string match)
GO-PSHV 2F18 -> PSHV                        ✓ (full-string match) 
SOME-VINCOM 304 L2-12 -> VINCOM304L2-12     ✓ (full-string match, was failing before)
TEST_VINCOM 304 -> VINCOM304L2-12           ✓ (full-string match)
SHOP-GO HLONG -> GOHALONG                   ✓ (full-string match)
PREFIX-BRVT-SUFFIX -> BARIA                 ✓ (full-string match)
```

## Impact

### Before Fix:
- `"VINCOM 304"` patterns would not be found due to whitespace mismatch
- Inconsistent account assignments for POS machines with whitespace in codes
- Poor counterparty matching accuracy

### After Fix:
- All whitespace-containing patterns are correctly matched and processed
- Consistent account determination across all POS machine types
- Improved counterparty search accuracy
- Better logging and debugging capabilities

## Files Modified

1. **`src/accounting/counterparty_extractor.py`**:
   - Enhanced `clean_department_code()` method
   - Reordered replacement logic (replacements before space removal)
   - Added full-string pattern matching
   - Improved logging and debugging output
   - Added pattern sorting by length for better matching

## Deployment Notes

- Changes are backward compatible
- No database schema changes required
- Enhanced logging provides better debugging capabilities
- Performance impact is minimal (additional pattern matching is fast)

## Testing Recommendations

When testing with BIDV 3840.xlsx files:
1. Verify that `VINCOM 304` patterns are correctly processed
2. Check that `PSHV` codes result in consistent account assignments
3. Monitor logs for proper department code transformations
4. Validate counterparty matching accuracy for complex patterns

## Future Enhancements

1. **Configuration**: Move department code mappings to database/config file
2. **Pattern Learning**: Add ability to learn new patterns from data
3. **Performance**: Add caching for frequently processed patterns
4. **Validation**: Add validation rules for department code mappings
