Fix for BIDV 4664 account discrepancy issue

This script addresses the issue where transactions with code "KL- PSHV 2F18" 
are getting accounts (1121121, 1311) instead of the expected (1121206, 1311).

The problem is in the account determination logic when processing transactions
from BIDV account 4664.
